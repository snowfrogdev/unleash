Welcome to the Unleash documentation, your one-stop shop to everything Unleash. Whether you're just getting started or have been using Unleash for years, you should be able to find answers to all your questions here.

## Getting help

Have questions that you can't find the answer to in these docs? You can always turn to [the Unleash Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/unleash-community/shared_invite/enQtNjUxMjU2MDc0MTAxLTJjYmViYjkwYmE0ODVlNmY1YjcwZGRmZWU5MTU1YTQ1Nzg5ZWQ2YzBlY2U1MjlmZDg5ZDRmZTMzNmQ5YmEyOGE) and ask us questions directly (or just come and hang out üòÑ).

## Documentation structure

Our documentation is split into four parts, using the [Diataxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/): documentation, how-to guides, topic guides, and reference documentation.

### Tutorials

New to Unleash? Not sure where to get started? The tutorials guide you through taking your first steps with Unleash.

### How-to guides

Our how-to guides show you how to perform a number of common tasks that you'll want to do. Think of them as recipes. They are more advanced than the tutorials and assume you have some working knowledge of Unleash.

### Topic guides

Topic guides discuss high-level concepts related to Unleash and provide extra background information and explanations around these concepts.

### Reference documentation

The reference docs contain technical reference for Unleash and the API. Go here to find out how Unleash works and what configuration options are available. They're like an Unleash encyclopedia and assume you have a grip on key Unleash concepts.
